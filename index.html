        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="description-info description-info-wide">
          You still with me? Awesome! I have been coding and doing web
          development for the past 2 years and when I was first introduced to
          it, I knew I found my calling in the career field. Utilizing
          technologies such as HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript to bring about
          solutions to your problems gives me the warm fuzzies and it's
          something I can see doing for many, many years to come. The times I am
          away from my computer not creating wonderful things, I can found
          working out, playing my gutiar, or drinking way to much coffee with my
          other software developer friends as we road trip to various tech
          meetups and networking events.
